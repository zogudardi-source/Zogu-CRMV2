# Welcome to Your Rebuilt Project!

This guide explains the new structure and helps you safely clean up your project.

## What Happened?

Your original code has been placed inside the `src` folder. This tool has added new, modern configuration files at the top level of the project to create a standard Vite application.

## Your Next Step: Clean Up Redundant Files

Because we've added new configuration files, some of your original files are now duplicates and should be deleted to avoid confusion.

**Action Required:** Review the files marked with a `üóëÔ∏è` icon in the project structure guide displayed in the auditor tool. These are typically old configuration files from your original project that are now inside the `src` folder.

**Common examples of files to delete:**
*   `src/package.json` (the project now uses the top-level `package.json`)
*   `src/vite.config.js` or `src/webpack.config.js`
*   `src/index.html` (the project uses the top-level `index.html`)
*   `src/README.md`
*   `src/.gitignore`

The goal is to leave only your application's components, pages, services, and logic inside the `src` folder.

Once you have cleaned up these files, follow the main `README.md` for instructions on how to install dependencies and run your project.
